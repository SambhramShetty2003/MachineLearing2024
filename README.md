# üß† Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository for my machine learning projects. This project aims to display all the datasets I have gone through my journey of AIML.
## üöÄ Project Overview

Model Prediction uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict the possible of the most desired outcome from already available data..

## üìà Project Details

### Description

This project utilizes concepts of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
### Data

- **Source:** www.kaggle.com
- **Size:** Almost 1 or 2 MB
- **Features:** different categorical and numerical columns.

### How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Multiple data processing step was taken whether it be converting the textual data to numerical data, converting the unbalanced data to balanced datas, converting the unlabel data to labeled data etc
2. **Model Training:** Models like Logistic Regression, Linear Regressor, Random Forest Calssifier and Regressor, Decision tree, etc are used in the aove projects of mine.
3. **Evaluation:** Till date we have only the Classification and Regression projects by me so I have used the accuracy_score and R2 squared mean error.
